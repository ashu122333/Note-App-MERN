# 📝 Notes App Backend – Day Progress

## 🌟 Context (Hook)
Today I focused on building out the backend of my simple note-taking application. The goal is to create a robust foundation for managing notes while integrating a proper database and following clean backend practices.

---

## 🚀 What I Built Today
- ✅ Created a backend to **Add, Update, Delete, and Get Notes**.  
- ✅ Integrated **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for persistent data storage.  
- ✅ Designed and implemented the **Schema** for notes.  
- ✅ Built **Routes** for CRUD operations.  
- ✅ Created **Controllers** to handle business logic.  
- ✅ Successfully integrated all modules into a working backend.  

Result:  
A fully functional backend that communicates with MongoDB to manage notes seamlessly. 🎉

## 📚 What I Learned / Challenge
- Learned how to connect and interact with MongoDB using Mongoose.  
- Practiced separating concerns by creating **routes, controllers, and schema** for cleaner project structure.  
- Overcame initial challenges in integrating everything smoothly into a working backend.

## 🔜 Next Up
- Add **rate limiting middleware** to enhance security and prevent abuse.  
- Plan for future improvements like authentication and deployment.
